# owl-manifest-tools.rs

The build-output inspector: reads a real flutter or rust/wasm build directory, emits the release manifest from what is actually there, and verifies a manifest against the tree it claims to describe.

Part of [`ores-wasm-loaders`](https://github.com/ores-wasm-loaders) — the org that owns the fleet's shared
web-loading layer for the 35+ marketing sites and their applications. Its sibling
[`ores-wasm-loaders-test`](https://github.com/ores-wasm-loaders-test) carries the external-facing test surface.

## What this org is for

Marketing sites are HTML-first and cheap. The applications behind them are not: a Flutter
web release or a Leptos/Dioxus island bundle costs a download, a compile and an
initialization before it is useful. This org shares the *loading and integration
infrastructure* across every product — one coordinator, one Flutter adapter, one Rust
adapter family, one manifest contract — so the expensive part is prepared while the visitor
is still reading, and so 80–90% of that plumbing is written once rather than 35 times.

It deliberately does **not** claim to share application bytes, application memory, or a
running runtime across a normal navigation. See `owl-docs/docs/architecture.md`.

## Conventions for this repository

- The manifest is generated from the emitted build graph, never from conventional filenames guessed by hand.
- Standard library only: this runs in every org's CI before any dependency is available.
- Verification is fail-closed: an asset in the manifest that is missing from the tree, a digest mismatch, or a mixed release id is an error, not a warning.

## Tests

```sh
cargo test
```

No third-party dependencies: the whole org builds and tests offline, because it has to run
in every product org's CI before anything else is installed.
